# THIS IS MY ARTIST STATEMENT - MY "WHY"

I wanted to provide an unconventional way for users to communicate in real-time, while presenting myself with a challenge.

I did not want to create another chat bot, so I thought an interesting way for strangers to communicate was by drawing. While the website only differentiates two colours, it does not mean that only two people can use it simultaneously. There is room for exploration but it is also limited enough to provide people with some contraint.
